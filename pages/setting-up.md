## The ARGoS Simulator
As mentioned in the introduction, in order to simulate both our robots and their environment, we'll use [ARGoS](http://www.argos-sim.info/), a multi-physics robot simulator easily customizable by adding new plug-ins. It can efficiently simulate large-scale swarms of robots. Its accuracy aims to be as close as possible to real simulation. It's a tool created with research in mind and used all around the world in laboratories. While we will use it as an educational tool, its constrains & quality are the same as those that would be required in a professional and research environment. In short: whatever you will create here will have real sense. If your behaviour is getting amazing result on a task, be ready to publish about it!

In order to run an experiment in ARGoS, you need three things:

* a **controller** - the code for the behavior of the robot(s),  either in C++ or in Lua;
* a **loop function** - the environment code (optional, and only in C++), either to update the environment (e.g., adding and moving objects) or to add a visualization layer (very practical for debugging);
* a **configuration file** - the .argos (XML format) file describing the experimental conditions, in particular, what robot code and environment code to use, and a description of the arena and robots.

The environment code will be provided, as well as the .argos file. While we don't recommend altering the C++ environment code, you can open the .argos experiment file, and make modifications (number of robots, initial positioning, size of the area...). That being said, you will focus on the robot's controller, and in this workshop you will use the Lua language. While slightly slower, it is easier learn, and iterate with.


### Setting Up ARGoS & Lua
ARGoS is developed for Linux first, but can also be installed on Mac and Windows. We will install ARGoS from source, which is a bit more tedious, but allow us to use the epuck robot, that we are currently using in research, and that will be used in our future arena. You need to have administrative privilege on your machine, or at least to have high enough clearance to be able to install software on it. If you’re not sure, please check with your IT department or give the tutorial a go! If you have any issues (or even just questions) during the installation process, be sure to reach me at roman.miletitch@mpi.nl.

If you are on Windows, please first go [here](./ref_win.html) in order to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and then continue the installation as follow. On Mac, you can install all of the necessary requirements using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh). In the command line, type the following command: `brew install pkg-config cmake libpng freeimage lua qt docbook asciidoc graphviz doxygen` and then continue the installation as follow. If you run into any specific trouble, be sure to contact the organisers.

For a generic version of the instalation process, you can refer [here](https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3) for ARGoS, and [here](https://github.com/demiurge-project/argos3-epuck) for the epuck plugin. In order to simplify the process, in case you are on a Debian/Ubuntu system, you can instead just run a script we prepared for you. It accesses the two github repositories (ARGoS and epuck), clone them localy, compile the code, and install it. To do so, create a new directory (here named *argos_workshop*, but you decide!) and then download and run the script:

```bash
mkdir argos_workshop
cd argos_workshop
wget -qO- "https://romamile.com/swlang/assets/install/install.sh" | bash
```

This will take some time, but should work fine!

In order to check if ARGoS is well installed, just run `argos3 --version` and a green text should appear with the version name of currently installed ARGoS. If you are curious about all the possibilities of ARGos, run `argos3 -q all` in the command line, it will returns you all the module that are installed. To learn more about a specific module, you can then run `argos3 -q *name-of-the-module*`. You can now fully test out ARGoS with the following command, from within your current working directory:
```bash
argos3 -c configTest.argos
```

Here, **argos3** is the name of the software, **-c** is what is called a flag, here meaning you will feed it a configuration file, and **configTest.argos** is the configuration file of the experiment we want to run here)

You should see two windows appearing. One with an arena, a painted floor and robots (where you are meant to run the experiment), and a text editor window (where you code your robot controller in Lua). If you see both things, congrats, you’re ready for the workshop! You are now free to explore the different log on the left, and learn about artificial behaviors.

#### Troubleshooting
If when trying to run ARGoS you see a red error message, please run the following commands, one by one:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3.12.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib/
sudo ldconfig
```

And run again ARGoS with the same command above.

If you see any other error messages, or if the previous one is still not resolved with those added commands, please do reach us, we will do our best to help you and update this tutorial incorporating your case issue. Thanks for helping us making this short tutorial better!

### Running ARGoS
<!-- First, create a working directory for the workshop (we recommend as well one directory per page for this workshop), download [here](./assets/setup/setup.tar.gz) the assets you will use in this workshop, and unpack them in your working directory. In it, you will find the environment code and experimental setup we will use, as well as some pictures we will put on the floor of the arena. Now, to run ARGoS, go in your command line, in your working directory, and run: `argos3 -c expSetup.argos`. The `-c` is a flag, telling argos that the file right of it will be used as a configuration file.
-->

So, your simulation is set, ready to be run. To do this, use the buttons at the top: the Play button plays the simulation, the Stop button stops it, the Forward button makes it quicker by only drawing every X frame (the number on its right). The button mixing pause and play makes the simulation step by step, perfect for debugging. In the center of the software, a view of your arena, and on its right, two text area for logging purposes. And the camera movement? Done in a not so classic (but workable) way using the mouse, you'll get the hang of it...


### Your first code
In the Lua code editor, you will find that there are already some functions defined, giving your code a structure. Already well explained in the comments, they are:

* **init** called once at the creation of the robots
* **step** called at each step of the experiment
* **reset** called when the reset button is pressed
* **destroy** called at the end of the experiment

On top of Lua's syntax and libraries, ARGoS provide you with a specific container, adequately called `robot`. Anything robot related (sensor & actuator) will go through it. We will also use as a control for further visualisation. Another thing to keep in mind: the classic `print` Lua function doesn't work here, you need to use the ARGoS log function, which redirects output to the logging text areas of the simulator.

Let's fill up  our experimentation with some code. Type inside the step function the following line, where `robot.id` refers to the robot own identification number.

```Lua
log("Hello, my name is " .. robot.id)
```

In order to run this code, you need first to upload it to ARGoS by clicking on the little gear icon in the menu on top, or by  pressing **Ctrl-E**. Once the code loaded, you just have to press play on the main ARGoS UI to run it. On the right side, you'll see time steps and logging information. In ARGoS, the simulation is executed steps by steps. At each steps (or ticks), the function `step` is called for each robot, and is resolved.

On top of that, you have two neat functionalities: if you *Shift + Click* on a robot in the arena view in ARGoS, two debbug panels will appear in the Lua editor, with a list of the robot's functions, variables, and their values. Last, once a robot is selected this way, you can teleport it to a new location by pressing *Ctrl + Click* somewhere in the arena.

## Reference Material
Lua is a quick straight forward scripting language. If you know python, you're in good hands. If you don't want python, you're still in good hands. There is scope for variables. If you want a variable to work as some global memory of your robot, you need to make it global by defining it at the top of your code (outside of any function). You'll see that Lua has only one data structure  type, *tables*, behaving as associative arrays, they store a set of key/value pairs. As mentioned earlier, to (re?)discover Lua and/or better understand this notion of table, you might want to check our [Lua reference page](./ref_lua.html), in combination with the other [ARGoS reference page](./ref_argos.html).
